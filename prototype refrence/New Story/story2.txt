Story 2: Implement central rounded card, counter and progress bar

Story statement:
Create the central rounded card containing label “Current Tasbeeh”, large numeric counter, `/goal` indicator and thin progress bar.

Why:
The central card is the primary focus area where users track progress. It must match reference for clarity and user engagement.

Acceptance criteria (AC):
1. Card has rounded corners and inner padding matching reference.
2. Big counter uses teal accent color and size similar to reference; `/100` is shown as smaller muted text.
3. A thin horizontal progress bar appears under the counter; increments animate smoothly as the counter changes.

Dev tasks:
- Build TasbeehCard component with container style: borderRadius 20–24px, padding ~30px, subtle inner background.
- Add label: "Current Tasbeeh" centered at top of card (14px, muted color).
- Add primary counter: large numeric display using heavy/tall numeric font. Include smaller "/ 100" under the number.
- Implement progress bar calculation: width = sessionCount / sessionGoal * 100%.
- Add animation to animate width changes and counter scale on increment.
- Add unit tests for progress computation and state updates.

Testing notes:
- Unit tests for progress calculation.
- Visual QA to validate sizes, spacing and color.
