Story 7: Persistence & restore on start

Story statement:
Implement persistent storage for sessionCount, totalCompleted and totalRecitations.

Why:
Data should survive app restarts so users don't lose progress.

Acceptance criteria (AC):
1. App restores persisted values on cold start.
2. All actions update persisted storage (no data loss on restart).
3. Write operations are debounced to avoid excessive I/O but not lose updates.

Dev tasks:
- Implement PersistenceService using SharedPreferences (Flutter) or equivalent local storage.
- Save keys: sessionCount, sessionGoal (if changed by user), totalCompleted, totalRecitations.
- Debounce writes (e.g., 200â€“500 ms) and flush on app pause/stop.
- Add migration handling for future changes (versioned keys).
- Add unit tests for persistence read/write and restore.

Testing notes:
- Manual test: increment, close app, re-open => values restored.
- Test large increments and multiple session completions persisted correctly.
