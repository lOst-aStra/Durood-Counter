Story 4: Replace control layout with left - button, center quick increments, right circular + button

Story statement:
Implement the exact control positioning and styles: small circular `-` on left, small pill `+10` and `+33` in center-bottom, large circular gradient `+` on right.

Why:
Controls must be prominent, touch-friendly, and mirror the reference layout for usability.

Acceptance criteria (AC):
1. Buttons sizes, shapes and colors match reference.
2. Buttons have accessible labels and press feedback (scale & shadow).
3. Layout responsive and maintains relative placement on varying screen widths.

Dev tasks:
- Build ControlRow component.
- Implement DecrementButton: circular ~56px, dark teal, white '-' icon.
- Implement QuickIncrementButtons: pill buttons ~56x36 px for +10 and +33 centered.
- Implement PrimaryIncrementButton: circular 80â€“96px with gradient, centered '+' glyph, shadow and press animation.
- Add accessible aria/semantics for buttons.
- Add press/tap animations (scale 0.96 and shadow intensity change).

Testing notes:
- Touch-target tests to ensure minimum 44x44 dp for tappable controls.
- Visual QA for placement and sizes.
