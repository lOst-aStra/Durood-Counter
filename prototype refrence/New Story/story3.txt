Story 3: Add “Total Tasbeeh Completed” inset panel

Story statement:
Inside the card add the inset rounded panel that displays a heart icon, total completed sessions count, and the line “Total recitations: X”.

Why:
Shows cumulative progress and gives users a sense of accomplishment.

Acceptance criteria (AC):
1. Panel visually matches reference: rounded, darker, with heart icon and correct typography.
2. The total updates when a session completes and reflects cumulative recitations.

Dev tasks:
- Create TotalsPanel component inside TasbeehCard.
- Add heart icon (SVG) and layout: icon left, big total number to the right, subtitle under number: "Total recitations: X".
- Style panel as inset rounded rectangle with slightly darker background than card.
- Wire totals to store and update when session completion logic triggers.

Testing notes:
- Unit tests: verify totals update when simulated session completion occurs.
- Visual QA for alignment and typography.
