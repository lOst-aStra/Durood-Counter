Story 6: Add Reset Session flow and footer message

Story statement:
Add reset session button under card with confirm modal and small footer message “May Allah accept your dhikr and grant you His blessings”.

Why:
Users need a quick way to restart a session; footer adds warmth and context.

Acceptance criteria (AC):
1. Reset shows confirmation modal with "Yes / Cancel".
2. On Yes: sessionCount resets to 0 but totals remain (unless explicitly cleared by separate action).
3. Footer text present and visually matched to the reference.

Dev tasks:
- Add ResetSessionControl component below the card.
- Add confirmation dialog on tap with accessible labels.
- Wire to reset only current sessionCount; do not modify totals unless there's a separate "clear stats" action.
- Add footer text element centered at bottom.

Testing notes:
- Unit test: verify reset clears sessionCount and persists.
- UX test: verify confirmation and cancel behavior.
