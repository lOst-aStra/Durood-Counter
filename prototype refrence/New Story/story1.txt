Story 1: Add header + Arabic phrase and global dark theme

Story statement:
Replace the current top bar with the centered “Durud Shareef” title flanked by moon & star icons and add the Arabic phrase below the title; update global theme to the reference dark gradient.

Why:
The header defines brand identity and must match the reference for visual parity and correct Arabic rendering.

Acceptance criteria (AC):
1. Title reads “Durud Shareef” and is horizontally centered at the top with a crescent moon icon to the left and a star to the right; icons match the reference shapes and colors.
2. Arabic line appears directly below the title, displayed with an Arabic font that supports diacritics and rendered RTL; its visual weight and spacing match the reference.
3. Global background uses a two-tone dark gradient and the page looks and feels like the reference screenshot.
4. Visual verification: header area pixel layout matches the reference within ±4 px on major elements.

Dev tasks:
- Create Header component / widget (e.g., HeaderWidget).
- Add SVG icons: crescent moon (left) and star (right).
- Center the title text “Durud Shareef”, apply correct font weight and size.
- Add Arabic text element below the title, use `dir="rtl"` and load a high-quality Arabic webfont (e.g., Noto Naskh Arabic or Scheherazade).
- Implement global background gradient (CSS body or app Scaffold background).
- Adjust safe-area/top padding to match spacing in reference.
- Add visual QA step: capture screenshot and compare header area.

Testing notes:
- Widget test to assert header elements present.
- Manual visual QA screenshot for pixel comparison.
- Accessibility check: title and icons have accessible labels.
