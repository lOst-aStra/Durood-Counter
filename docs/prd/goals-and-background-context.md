# Goals and Background Context

## Goals
- Deliver a minimal, distraction‑free Android app to aid Durood Shareef recitation with essential counting features.
- Enable immediate use: reach first increment within 1–2 seconds from app open.
- Ensure reliable session continuity with counts persisting across restarts until reset.
- Provide a beautiful, legible UI featuring Arabic Durood header and large, accessible controls.
- Support quick increments (+10, +33) and safe decrement (no negative totals), with clear reset.
- Offer offline‑first experience with no ads or tracking.

## Background Context
DuroodCounter addresses a focused need for users who regularly recite Durood Shareef and want an effortless way to track recitations. Many existing apps include ads or unnecessary complexity, introducing friction before users can begin. By prioritizing simplicity and a spiritually aligned design, DuroodCounter removes distractions and streamlines counting: a large primary +1 action, quick bulk adds (+10, +33), safe decrement, and an intuitive reset. 

The app persists state across app restarts to respect a user’s ongoing session. The UI emphasizes readability and calm aesthetics, with RTL support and a dedicated Arabic header, making it suitable for a wide range of users including elders who benefit from large tap targets and high contrast.
