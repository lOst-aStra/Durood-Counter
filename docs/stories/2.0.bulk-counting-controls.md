# Story 2.0: Bulk Counting Controls and Safety Features

## User Story
As a user, 
I want bulk increment options and safe decrement functionality with proper visual feedback,
so that I can count efficiently and correct mistakes without breaking my count.

## Technical Context
- Builds upon existing counter functionality from Epic 1
- Requires haptic feedback implementation from story 1.4
- Uses existing DataStore persistence from story 1.3
- Follows Material Design 3 theming and accessibility guidelines

## Acceptance Criteria

### Bulk Increment Functionality
1. **+10 Button**
   - Tapping adds 10 to current count
   - Correctly handles rollover at 100s boundary (e.g., 95 + 10 = 05, increments completed sets)
   - Provides haptic feedback on press
   
2. **+33 Button**
   - Tapping adds 33 to current count
   - Correctly handles rollover at 100s boundary
   - Provides haptic feedback on press

### Safe Decrement Functionality
3. **-1 Button**
   - Tapping reduces count by 1, but never below 0
   - Disables button when count is 0 (visual feedback)
   - Maintains data consistency with completed sets counter
   - Provides haptic feedback on press

### UI/UX Requirements
4. **Accessibility & Interaction**
   - All buttons meet minimum 48x48dp touch target size
   - Sufficient color contrast (4.5:1 minimum)
   - Clear visual feedback on all interactions
   - Maintains RTL support
   - Numeric display remains highly legible

5. **Performance**
   - All operations complete within 16ms (60fps)
   - No frame drops during rapid tapping
   - Smooth animations for all state changes

## Technical Tasks
1. Add new increment buttons to layout
2. Implement bulk increment logic with rollover
3. Implement safe decrement logic
4. Add visual feedback states
5. Integrate haptic feedback
6. Implement accessibility features
7. Add unit tests for all new functionality
8. Update UI tests for new elements
9. Verify RTL support
10. Performance testing and optimization

## Dependencies
- Haptic feedback system (story 1.4)
- Data persistence (story 1.3)
- Existing counter UI components

## Success Metrics
- All acceptance criteria met
- 100% test coverage for new code
- No performance regressions
- Accessibility scanner passes all checks
- Positive user feedback on interaction feel
