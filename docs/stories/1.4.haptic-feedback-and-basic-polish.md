# Story 1.4: Haptic feedback and basic polish

## Status
Ready

## Story
As a user,
I want subtle haptic feedback on primary actions,
so that interactions feel responsive without being distracting. [Source: docs/prd/epic-1-foundation-core-counter.md]

## Acceptance Criteria
1: Haptics on +1 tap (respect device/user settings)
2: Visual feedback on press
3: No regressions in performance targets for this epic

## Non-Goals
- Complex animations
- Custom vibration patterns
- Sound effects

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Implement haptic feedback for +1 button
- [ ] Add visual feedback for button press state
- [ ] Verify performance metrics meet targets
- [ ] Add unit tests for haptic logic
- [ ] Add UI tests for visual feedback

## Dev Notes
### Haptic Feedback Implementation
- No specific guidance found in architecture docs
- Standard approach: Use `performHapticFeedback()` with `HapticFeedbackConstants.KEYBOARD_TAP`
- Should respect system haptic settings

### Visual Feedback
- No specific guidance found in architecture docs
- Recommended: Use Compose `Modifier.indication` with ripple effect
- Ensure contrast with button background color

### Performance Considerations
- Haptics should be non-blocking
- Visual feedback shouldn't cause frame drops
- Profile on low-end devices

## Testing
- Unit tests for haptic enable/disable logic
- Instrumentation tests for actual vibration
- UI tests for visual feedback states
- Performance profiling
